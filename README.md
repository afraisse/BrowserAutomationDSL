# BrowserAutomationDSL

This repository is an academic project at l'Ecole des Mines de Nantes. It is part of the Modeling class.
Our aim was to built a DSL for Browser automation, using eclipse modeling tooling EMF and Xtext.
Our DSL is interpreted by our program, which then delegate browser automation to a Selenium driver.

## Case Study - Adrian Fraisse, Th√©ophile Morin, Killian Saint Cricq

We implemented our Selenium DSL using an interpreter which is to be found in the Selenium.interpreter project.
Exemples can be found under the samples folder. Our DSL file extension is .SEL. Please note that only the exemple CampusTest.sel really works - the others are juste here to demonstrate the grammar.

## How to run the interpreter

- Import the projects into eclipse
- In the Selenium project, run the MWE workflow (pkg : org.xtext.emn.selenium.GenerateSEL)
- Run the Selenium.interpreter as an Eclipse application
- In the new Eclipse instance, create a new general project
- Add a file to the project with the .SEL extension
- Run the interpreter using the plugin button "Execute the currently selected SEL script"

Feedback will be printed in the parent eclipse instance's console.

## How to configure the webDrivers binary path

Selenium will automatically find your default browsers. Although, if you need to run tests on other browsers you have to specify the path to their binaries.

- In the new Eclipse instance, along to test files (.sel), copy the config.properties file from the base instance of Eclipse (Selenium.Interpreter/samples).
- In the config.properties, you can choose between 4 web browsers (chrome, firefox, ie and safari)
- you can change the values of the keys (ex: *emn.selenium.config.chrome*) to the WebDriver binary path(*emn.selenium.config.chrome=C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/driver/chromedriver.exe*).

## Project history

We used Github as a collaboration tool. You can find the complete history of the project [here](org.xtext.emn.selenium.GenerateSEL).
